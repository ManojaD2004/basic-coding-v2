# Basic Coding Test V2 Question (Total 10 Marks):

## 1. You are a programmer in BGSCET College, get the following things working correctly: 
#### a. Create a student strict/object with following fields: name - string, usn - string, branch - string, phone_no - int, sex - string, sgpa - double, is_pass - boolean (make it as int, 1 means TRUE, 0 means FALSE). - 1 M (Compulsory)

#### b. Create a function to create that object and append that to a global list [takes branch, usn, name, phone_no, sex, and sgpa as agrument]. - 1 M (Compulsory)

#### c. If an student sgpa is less than 3.5, then set is_pass to FALSE (0). - 1 M

#### d. When adding a new student make sure that the same usn and phone_no cannot be repeated. - 2 M 

#### e. Create a function to list all Male/Female students in table form. - 1 M

#### f. Create a function to list only pass student (is_pass is 1). - 1 M (After doing c)

#### g. Create a function to list student only by particular branch [takes branch as agrument]. - 3 M

### Additional Question, try at home!

#### 2.a. Create a function to update sgpa of student using their usn.

#### 2.b. Create a function to list a student by thier usn.

#### 2.c. Add more advance error handling technique, like when entering phone_no make sure it should be only 10 digit, if not tell to re enter again.

#### 2.d. Try to store students data in a file in your own format (CSV, or JSON format recommended), and load it later in the program (File Operations). 

#### 2.e. Create a function to list the students in descending and ascending ordering of sgpa.

#### 2.f. Create a function to delete a student object/struct by their usn.

#### 2.f. Create a function to search student data by their name (substring should exist in the string, ex: Alan B, and Alan D, are two students, if I search by name of Alan, I should get both student data of both, Alan B, and Alan D, because 'Alan' substring exist in string 'Alan B', and 'Alan D').

### (Note: Create 5 student initially.)

### (Note: Get the output in the table form!)
